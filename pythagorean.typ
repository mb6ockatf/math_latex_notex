= Euclid's Proof
Has been the most popular proof of the theorem for like 2000 years. It was
written in first book of "Elements", sentence 47. Same proof mentioned in
geometry students' book of A. P. Kiselev. "Pythaghorean pants" is a joke name
for figure needed for proof.

= Algrebraic Proof
Has been used it Atanasyan's geometry students' book

= By Triangles Similiarity
Shown in Kiselev's geometry students' book. Put the height from 90#sym.degree
angle onto the hypotenuse, and the resulting 2 triangles are similar to the
larger one. Then do the fractions, and you will get the final equation.

= By Angle's cos

= The Oldest Proof
Was first mentioned in work of BhƒÅskara II. Literally, the wierdest one.

= Hawkins' Proof

= Gofman's Proof
